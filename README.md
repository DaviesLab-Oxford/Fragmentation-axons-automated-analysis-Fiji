# Fragmentation-axons-automatic-analysis-Fiji

It is a pipeline for analysing fragmentation of axons after co-culturing with NK cells.

Please follow the steps below:

Step 1: Automatically measure total area of BtubIII+ axons and BtubIII+ particles by running the script 'Neurite fragmention_Macro_BtubIII.ijm'.

Step 2: Save 'Summary'containing total area of BtubIII+ particles and 'Results'containing total area of BtubIII+ axons.

Step 3: Calculate fragmentation (%) of axons: 

        Fragmentation(%) = total area / BtubIII+ particles / total area / BtubIII axons
